<br />
在 Macintosh Classic II 的 ROM 中，Apple 犯了一个错误，本应导致系统无法启动。然而，**Motorola MC68030 CPU** 意外执行了一条未定义的指令，避免了崩溃并成功启动。通过 MAME 模拟器，作者发现 Classic II 在 **32 位寻址模式** 下无法启动，原因是 ROM 代码中的 **BoxFlag** 值超出范围，导致 CPU 执行了无效指令。有趣的是，实际硬件并未出现此问题，推测是模拟器与硬件行为的差异所致。

<br />
英格兰北部的经济衰退源于**历史性中央集权**、**大学设立过晚**以及**工业革命后的制度破坏**。自1066年以来，英格兰一直由东南部统治，北方大学在17世纪被禁止设立，导致工业革命依赖苏格兰科技。20世纪后，**撒切尔政府的中央集权政策**进一步削弱了北方的经济自主权，导致其长期落后于苏格兰和爱尔兰。尽管曼彻斯特等城市展现了局部成功，但整体上，北方仍受制于中央政府的偏见和资源分配不均。
